  <h1>Homework 1: Rasterizer</h1>
  <p>Yash Shah — CS184 Spring 2026</p>

  <h2>Task 1: Drawing Single-Color Triangles</h2>

  <h3>Implementation</h3>
  <p>
    To rasterize a triangle, I first compute its axis-aligned bounding box by taking the minimum and maximum
    x and y values across the triangle’s three vertices. I then iterate over all pixels within this box and
    sample at the center of each pixel using (x + 0.5, y + 0.5), as specified in the assignment.
  </p>
  <p>
    For each sample point, I use edge functions to test whether the point lies inside the triangle. If the
    sample is inside the triangle or on its boundary, I fill the pixel with the triangle’s color using
    <code>fill_pixel()</code>.
  </p>

  <h3>Efficiency</h3>
  <p>
    My algorithm only checks pixels inside the triangle’s bounding box rather than scanning the entire framebuffer.
    Each pixel in the bounding box is tested once, so the runtime is proportional to the area of the bounding box.
    This is no worse than a method that checks every sample in the triangle’s bounding box.
  </p>

  <h3>Result (basic/test4.svg + Pixel Inspector)</h3>
  <p>
    The screenshot below was generated using the GUI <code>S</code> hotkey, with the pixel inspector enabled and centered
    on an interesting edge region.
